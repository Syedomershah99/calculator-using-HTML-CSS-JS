# calculator using HTML CSS JS
 I have created a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was an exhilarating experience for me to create a fully functional calculator from scratch.   The calculator allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes functionality for clearing the display and calculating percentages.  I have designed the calculator to be user-friendly, with a clear and simple interface that is easy to navigate. The calculator is also mobile responsive, making it easy to use on any device.  In addition, I have added sound effects to enhance the user experience. The calculator makes a sound when a button is clicked, providing auditory feedback to the user.  Overall, I am thrilled with how this project turned out, and I hope you find it useful. Please feel free to leave any feedback or suggestions in the comments below, and don't forget to share it with your friends! Thank you.
